## Overview of Project 
The purpose of this project is to continue helping Louise draw conclusions from past kickstarter campaigns so that she can make infromed decisions. She is particularly want to understand the success of the campaigns in relation to their launch dates and funding goals. 

## Analysis and Challenges 
Explain how you performed your analysis using images and links to code, as well as any challenges you encountered and how you overcame them. If you had no challenges, describe any possible challenges or difficulties that could be encountered.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date?
May was the month with the most successful campaigns
May june july august and october all have a similar amount of failed campaigns 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
I can conclude that kickstarter campaigns for plays are more than 50% successful if the goal falls between these four brackets: less than 1000, 1000 to 4999, 35000 to 39999, and 40000 to 44999. 
I can also conclude that all the kickstarter campaigns for plays that have a goal between 45000 and 49999 have a 100% failure rate. 
I can conclude that kickstarter campaigns for plays are more than 50% failed if the goal falls between these four brackets: 25000 to 29999, 30000 to 34999, 45000 to 49999, and greater than 50000. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?


- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
